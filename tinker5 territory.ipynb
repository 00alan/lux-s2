    "- the territory metric, which takes a rubble weighted average of tiles near the factory, with weights decreasing with distance from center, will essentially be telling us how easy it will be for the factory to grow lichen and generate more power in the early to mid game. and it seems a power advangtage is mainly effective in helping destroy enemy robots. but also note that power advantage is useless in predicting winner (see leaderboard match replays) and it is essential that power keeps on getting used, for example to remove rubble near factory or two eat enemy robots\n",
